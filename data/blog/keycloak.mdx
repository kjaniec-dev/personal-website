## Keycloak docker-compose

Just paste the code below into a file and name it `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  keycloak:
    image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.0
    environment:
      KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
      KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - '8000:8080'
    command:
      - start-dev
```

Run the command `docker compose up -d` and open the URL `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Log in to Keycloak with the username and password - in the file, both are `admin`.

## Keycloak internal setup

1. Create the realm

<Image
  src="/static/images/new_realm.png"
  alt="dropdown menu to create the realm"
  width={564}
  height={636}
/>

Fill in the name and click create.

2. Create the client

Click `clients` in the sidebar and click `Create client`. Fill in the `Client ID`, which is very important and commonly used in OAuth libraries.

<Image
  src="/static/images/create_oidc_client.webp"
  alt="create client settings"
  width={2036}
  height={1674}
/>

I would leave these settings as they are, because the most popular and widely used flow is the code flow, which is enabled by the `standard flow` checkbox.

Next, you should determine your URIs. For Angular, it can look like this:

<Image
  src="/static/images/login_settings_oidc_client.webp"
  alt="create client - login settings"
  width={2114}
  height={1680}
/>
3) Create the user There's nothing complicated here, just fill in the inputs. 4) Create a password
for the user In the `Credentials` tab, you can set the password for your user.

That's it! You're good to go with development :)
