## Keycloak docker-compose

Just paste code below to file and name it `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  keycloak:
    image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.0
    environment:
      KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
      KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - '8000:8080'
    command:
      - start-dev
```

Run command `docker compose up -d` and open in the browser url `http://localhost:8000`. Login to the keycloak with user and password - in a file both are `admin`.

## Keycloak internal setup

1) Create the realm
![dropdown menu to create the realm](/static/images/new_realm.png)
Fill the name and click create.

2) Create the client
Click `clients` in a sidebar and click `Create client`. Fill the `Client ID`, which is very important and commonly used in oauth libraries.
![create client settings](/static/images/create_oidc_client.png) This settings I would leave that way, because the most popular and used everywhere is code flow which is in `standard flow` checkbox.
Next you should determine your URIs. For Angular it can look like this:
![create client - login settings](/static/images/login_settings_oidc_client.png)
3) Create the user
There's nothing complicated here, just fill the inputs.
4) Create a password for the user
In the `Credentials` tab you are able to set the password for your user.

That's it! You are good to go with a development :)
