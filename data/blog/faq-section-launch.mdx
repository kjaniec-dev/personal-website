## Why add an FAQ section?

After receiving similar questions repeatedly via email and LinkedIn, I realized there was a need for a centralized place where people could quickly find answers. Whether you're a potential client, collaborator, or just curious about my work, the new FAQ section is designed to give you the information you need without the back-and-forth.

## What you'll find

The FAQ section is organized into four main categories: **Technical Preferences**, **Work & Experience**, **Personal**, and **Contact & Collaboration**. Each category groups related questions to make it easy to find what you're looking for.

## How it's built

The FAQ section uses a clean, accordion-style interface that lets you:
- Browse questions by category with distinct visual groupings
- Expand and collapse answers as needed
- Quickly scan through questions to find what you're looking for
- Navigate smoothly with responsive design that works on all devices

Technically, it's powered by:
- **TypeScript** for type-safe FAQ data management
- **React** for the interactive accordion component
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling with the rest of the site
- **Category filtering** to show only relevant questions

## Making it discoverable

The FAQ section replaced the previous "Learning" tab in the main navigation, giving it prominent placement. This wasn't a light decision - I felt that having readily available answers to common questions would provide more value to visitors than showcasing my ongoing learning journey (which is better reflected in my blog posts and projects).

## Continuous improvement

This isn't a static page. As I receive new questions or realize gaps in the current content, I'll keep adding and refining the FAQ entries. Already, I've expanded it to include questions about:
- Cloud platform expertise and DevOps capabilities
- Challenging projects and lessons learned
- Technical consulting and code review services
- Notice periods and timezone flexibility

## Your feedback matters

If you have questions that aren't answered in the FAQ, please reach out! Your questions help me understand what information is most valuable and will shape future updates to this section.

You can find the new FAQ section in the main navigation at the top of the site. I hope it makes it easier for you to get to know me and my work. Happy browsing!
