## Why add an FAQ section?

After receiving similar questions repeatedly via email and LinkedIn, I realized there was a need for a centralized place where people could quickly find answers. Whether you're a potential client, collaborator, or just curious about my work, the new FAQ section is designed to give you the information you need without the back-and-forth.

## What you'll find

The FAQ section is organized into four main categories to make navigation intuitive:

### Technical Preferences

Get insights into my favorite programming languages, frameworks, and development tools. Learn about my cloud platform experience with AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and Docker. Whether you're wondering about my tech stack choices or DevOps capabilities, you'll find comprehensive answers here.

### Work & Experience

Discover what types of projects excite me most, from distributed IoT systems to real-time applications. Find out about my availability, notice periods, and whether I offer consulting services. I've also shared details about my most challenging projects and what I learned from them.

### Personal

Beyond the code, learn a bit about who I am. From my gaming preferences (yes, I'm a Souls games fan) to my coffee choices, this section offers a glimpse into my life outside of development. You'll also find out the story behind the "kjaniec.dev" domain name.

### Contact & Collaboration

Find the best ways to reach me, learn about my timezone (CET/CEST - Poland), and discover what types of collaborations I'm open to. Whether it's open-source contributions, technical consulting, or code reviews, you'll know exactly how we can work together.

## How it's built

The FAQ section uses a clean, accordion-style interface that lets you:
- Browse questions by category with distinct visual groupings
- Expand and collapse answers as needed
- Quickly scan through questions to find what you're looking for
- Navigate smoothly with responsive design that works on all devices

Technically, it's powered by:
- **TypeScript** for type-safe FAQ data management
- **React** for the interactive accordion component
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling with the rest of the site
- **Category filtering** to show only relevant questions

## Making it discoverable

The FAQ section replaced the previous "Learning" tab in the main navigation, giving it prominent placement. This wasn't a light decision - I felt that having readily available answers to common questions would provide more value to visitors than showcasing my ongoing learning journey (which is better reflected in my blog posts and projects).

## Continuous improvement

This isn't a static page. As I receive new questions or realize gaps in the current content, I'll keep adding and refining the FAQ entries. Already, I've expanded it to include questions about:
- Cloud platform expertise and DevOps capabilities
- Challenging projects and lessons learned
- Technical consulting and code review services
- Notice periods and timezone flexibility

## Your feedback matters

If you have questions that aren't answered in the FAQ, please reach out! Your questions help me understand what information is most valuable and will shape future updates to this section.

You can find the new FAQ section in the main navigation at the top of the site. I hope it makes it easier for you to get to know me and my work. Happy browsing!
