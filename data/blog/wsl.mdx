## What is WSL?

This will be a short post, but I think it's worth mentioning Linux on Windows.

> Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting. WSL is designed to provide a seamless and productive experience for developers who want to use both Windows and Linux at the same time.

Generally speaking, it's a Linux kernel inside the Windows system. I'm a software engineer who likes programming on *nix systems. I always used to install Linux alongside Windows on separate disks. However, that has changed because of `WSL`.

This site is developed on a Linux kernel on Windows. I must say I don't see any difficulties or problems in personal development. I don't know how it would be in commercial cases, and maybe something would be problematic. For personal development, you can use git, Docker powered by WSL, Visual Studio Code, and the entire JetBrains stack. It's more than enough for personal coding.
Every project should be on Linux, but IDEs should be installed on Windows. The biggest advantage is that you don't have to install Linux on a separate partition, and you don't have to choose which system to enter in GRUB ;)
Your home directory is mapped to a Windows directory, so you can see files on Linux from Windows - for example, `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu`. For personal cases, I think I can recommend this setup, and if something difficult occurs, I'll let you know.
