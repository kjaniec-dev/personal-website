## What is WSL?

It will be short post, but I think it's worth to mention about linux on windows.

> Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting. WSL is designed to provide a seamless and productive experience for developers who want to use both Windows and Linux at the same time.

Generally speaking, it's a linux kernel inside windows system. I'm a software engineer who like to programming on *unix system. I always install linux aside with windows on separate disks. However, it's been changed because of `WSL`.

This site is developed on linux kernel on windows. I must say I don't see any difficulties, problems in personal development. I do not know how it would be on commercial cases and maybe something will be problematic. To personal development you can use git, docker powered by wsl, visual studio code, all jetbrains stack. It's more than enough for making personal coding.
Every project you should have on Linux, but IDEs should be installed on windows. The biggest advantage is you do not have to install linux on separate partition, you do not have to choose which system you enter in a grub ;)
Your home directory is mapped to windows directory, so you see files on Linux in a Windows i.e. - `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu`. For personal cases I think I can recommend this setup and if something difficult occurred I'll let you know.
