## Where I found the template

I saw this template on [Jamstack Themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev) - a site that aggregates JAMStack websites (an acronym for JavaScript-APIs-Markup).
If you don't know this website and you'd like to have a blog or personal site, it's very likely you'll find a template that suits you :).

If you like this template, you can see it at this [link](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/nextjs-tailwind-starter-blog/).

## A few things about this project website

This website has a lot of stars on Jamstack Themes, and I'm not surprised about that.
If you look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), you'll see a complete personal website project that is almost ready to deploy ;)
On GitHub, you'll have a quick start guide, so I'm not going to write about it here. Rather, I would like to give you my opinion about this template.
Here's a list of what I like about this project:
1) Writing your blog posts in Markdown! Or even more, because this template uses MDX, which lets you use JSX in Markdown.
2) Dependencies in the project are minimal, so it's not another JS project with a lot of unnecessary libraries
3) Next.js and Tailwind CSS on board. I know React.js, and I developed a Bootstrap website in the past, so for me, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS is quite natural. I also want to develop with these technologies to learn them better :)
4) I saved a lot of time by not having to build a project like this from scratch. I just forked it, customized it, and deployed it :)
5) A piece of good code (I have two minor issues I disagree with, but overall I must say it's quite nice)
6) Excellent scoring in Lighthouse metrics (of course Next.js solves some issues, but I'm sure the author fixed a lot of things to achieve great results). I'd like to see if a score of 100 is possible ;)

What are the minor issues I don't like in this template? Just two things - the first is single quotes in the code. I had to change it, because single quotes are JavaScript style, not TypeScript style. Of course, I know what it causes - conflicts when I sync the fork with its original repository. But it's stronger than me.
The second thing is the props in the components - not all have them, and I want them everywhere. Just to make the code more 'TypeScript style'. These two minor issues don't affect the overall rating of the template.

## What I changed/added to this template

1) I disabled comments. I don't think it's good and doesn't make sense (for a start, maybe later when more people read my site, it will be more convincing for me).
2) I added a timeline component to present the experience and education sections
3) I added a radial progress component to present skills

## Future plans

- Write more posts on tech/games topics
- Developer snippets?
- Present my completed courses in a better way when there are more courses
- Create a game zone tab where I present games I currently play
- Use some UI kit, but currently I don't consider it a must-have
