## Where I found the template?

I saw this template in a [Jamstack Themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev) - a site which aggregates JAM Stack websites (abbr. Javascript-APIs-Markup).
If you don't know this website and you'd like to have a blog/personal site, it's very likely you will find a template for you :).

If you like this template you will see it in this [link](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/nextjs-tailwind-starter-blog/).

## A few things about this project website

This website have a lot of stars in a jamstack themes and I'm not surprised about that.
If you look on a [github repo](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) you will see a complete personal website project which is almost ready to deploy ;)
On a github you'll have quick start guide so I am not gonna write here about it. Rather, I would like to give you my opinion about this template.
Here's a list what I like in this project:
1) Writing you blog posts in a markdown! Or even more, because this template uses MDX which let you use a JSX in a markdown.
2) Dependencies in a project are minimal, so it is not a another js project with a lot of unnecessary libraries
3) Next.JS and Tailwind.CSS on a board. I know React.JS, I developed a Bootstrap website in a past, so for me using Next.JS and Tailwind.CSS is quite natural. I also want to develop in these technologies to know them more :)
4) I saved a lot of time to do a project like this. Just forked it, customize it and deploy it :)
5) A piece of a good code (I have two minor issues on which I disagree, but overall I must say it's quite nice)
6) Excellent scoring in a Lighthouse metrics (of course Next.js solves some issues, but I'm sure an author fixed a lot of things to achieve great result). I'd like to see if 100 score is possible ;)

What's the minor issues I don't like in this template? Just two things - first is single quotes in a code. I have to change it, because single quotes are javascript style, not typescript style. Of course, I know what it causes - a conflicts when I sync fork with its original repository. It's stronger than me.
Second thing are the props in a components - not all have it and I wanna have it everywhere. Just make the code to be more 'typescript style'. These two minor issues don't apply on overall rating of the template.

## What I change/add to this template
1) I disabled comments. I don't think it's good and make sense (for a start, maybe later when more people read my site it will be more convincing for me).
2) I added timeline component to present experience and education section
3) I added radial progress component to present skills

## Future plans
- Write more posts on tech/games topics
- Developer snippets?
- Present my completed courses in a better way when it will be more courses
- Create a game zone tab where I present games I currently play on
- Use some UI kit, but currently I don't take it as a must-have
