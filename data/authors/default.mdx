I'm Krzysztof Janiec, a passionate software engineer from Poland with over 10 years of experience in full-stack application development. I specialize in building scalable, maintainable solutions across diverse domains.

Currently, I work in the e-commerce field, but my experience spans IoT systems, ERP solutions (including finance, logistics, and more), and various other industries. I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and continuously expanding my skill set.

I work remotely by choice - my home setup includes a treadmill desk and multiple displays for optimal ergonomics and productivity. If remote work is a deal-breaker for you, I'm probably not the right fit ;)

It's worth noting that I operate as a contractor (B2B with invoicing), so traditional employment contracts aren't an option for me :)

My skills and experience are detailed below.
