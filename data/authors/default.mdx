Krzysztof Janiec is a software engineer from Poland. I have more than 10 years of experience in full-stack apps development.

Currently, I work in e-commerce field, but I also worked in IoT field or for some ERP (finance, logistics and so on).

I'm a remote developer because of ergonomics - (treadmill / more displays at home). If remote work is an issue for you, probably I'm not a good candidate ;)
It's worth to mention that I work as a contractor (B2B, invoicing etc.) so any kind of employment contract is not an option for me :)

Skills, experience you have written below.
